               <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
                    of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                    include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. Education frequently
                    takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.
                    Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative
                    effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
                    teaching is called pedagogy.

                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                    school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions,
                    education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

                    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city
                    of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual
                    cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.
                    European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome
                    in CE 476.[4]

                    In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                    philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours
                    like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who
                    would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have
                    continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[5]</p>

                    they would receive rigorous religious and military training. The Aztecs also had a well-developed

                    After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in
                    Western Europe.[9] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of
                    advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and
                    forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.[4] During the High Middle Ages, Chartres
                    Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities
                    of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of
                    inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas
                    Aquinas of the University of Naples, </p>

               <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                    purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                    classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject.

                    The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a
                    statistical base to compare education systems.[17] In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25
                    fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version
                    ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into
                    three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early
                    childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.[18]
